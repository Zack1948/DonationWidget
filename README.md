DonationWidget
==============

The donation widget requires no programming experience and creates a HTML5 code that can be inserted into your webpage allowing supporters to donate funds from Android, iOS, Blackberry, and computing devices to your cause.  It also has the ability to generate a QR code for accepting donations from posters, mailers, business cards, and other printed materials.
